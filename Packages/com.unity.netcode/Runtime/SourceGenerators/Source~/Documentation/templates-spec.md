## GHOST SERIALIZER
The following regions and variables are not user facing. They are part of the GhostComponentSerializer template, that users can't customize.
### REGIONS
|||
|------|------|
|GHOST_USING_STATEMENT|will contains all the default and custom using statements|

|GHOST_COPY_FROM_SNAPSHOT_ENABLE_EXTRAPOLATION||
|GHOST_COPY_FROM_SNAPSHOT_INTERPOLATE_CLAMP_MAX||
|GHOST_FLUSH_COMPONENT_CHANGE_MASK|write the change mask bits into the mask buffer|
|GHOST_FLUSH_FINAL_COMPONENT_CHANGE_MASK|write the remaining change mask bits to mask buffer. Called at the end of the component serialization|
|GHOST_REFRESH_CHANGE_MASK|copy a batch of change mask bits (32) from the mask buffer. Used when the component data is de-serialized|
|GHOST_PREDICTION_ERROR_HEADER|contains setup code run once before calculating the prediction error|
### VARIABLES
|||
|------|------|
|GHOST_NAME|the component name|
|GHOST_NAMESPACE|the component namespace|
|GHOST_VARIANT_HASH|the calculated variant hash|
|GHOST_VARIANT_TYPE|the variant typename|
|GHOST_FIELD_HASH|the calculated field hash, used later by runtime to calculate the protocol version|
|GHOST_PREFAB_TYPE|the ghostcomponent PrefabType property|
|GHOST_SEND_MASK|the ghostcomponent SendMask property|
|GHOST_SEND_OWNER|the ghostcomponent SendOwner property|
|GHOST_MAX_INTERPOLATION_DISTSQ|the max allowed distance before snapping the current field to its new value instead of interpolating it|
|GHOST_CHANGE_MASK_BITS|the total number of mask bits calculated so far|

## TYPE TEMPLATE
The following variables and regions can be used by the user when writing custom templates.
### VARIABLES
|||
|------|------|

|GHOST_QUANTIZE_SCALE|the quantization factor used to convert from float to fixed point format|
|GHOST_DEQUANTIZE_SCALE|the quantization factor used to convert from fixed point to float format|
|GHOST_COMPONENT_TYPE|the full type name of the component|
|GHOST_FIELD_REFERENCE|the field path used to access the |
|GHOST_USING|the using statement list|
|GHOST_MASK_INDEX|the current bit index in the change mask. From 0 to 31|
### REGIONS
|||
|------|------|
|GHOST_FIELD| fields that will be added the snapshot for this type | 
|GHOST_IMPORTS| user defined using statement that should be included in the serializer code|
|GHOST_RESTORE_FROM_BACKUP||
|GHOST_PREDICT| code that calculate the predicted value for the current field |
|GHOST_READ| code that deserialise the field value for the byte stream |
|GHOST_WRITE| code that serialize the field value to the byte stream |
|GHOST_COPY_TO_SNAPSHOT| contains the code to copy component field data to the snapshot struct |
|COPY_FROM_SNAPSHOT_SETUP| placeholder region that will contains the code for setting the serialization based if the struct is a buffer or component|
|GHOST_COPY_FROM_SNAPSHOT|copied into the COPY_FROM_SNAPSHOT_SETUP|
|GHOST_COPY_FROM_BUFFER | copied into the COPY_FROM_SNAPSHOT_SETUP|
|GHOST_COPY_FROM_SNAPSHOT_INTERPOLATE_SETUP|optional region, can contains initialization code used by the GHOST_COPY_FROM_SNAPSHOT_INTERPOLATE region|

|GHOST_COPY_FROM_SNAPSHOT_INTERPOLATE|code for interpolate the field value in between the Before and After snapshot values|
|GHOST_CALCULATE_CHANGE_MASK|contains the code to check and update the change mask bits|
|GHOST_CALCULATE_CHANGE_MASK_ZERO|contains the code to check and set the change mask bits. Used when the mask is reset or after 32 mask bits has been written|
|GHOST_REPORT_PREDICTION_ERROR|the code tha calculate the error (as distance usually) in between the current and predicted value for the current field|
