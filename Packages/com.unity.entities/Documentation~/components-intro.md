# Components overview

Components represent the data in the [Entity Component System](concepts-intro.md) (ECS) architecture. [Entities](concepts-entities.md) associate components together and [systems](concepts-systems.md) provide logic that can read from and write to the component data. This section introduces ECS components and explains how to use them.
