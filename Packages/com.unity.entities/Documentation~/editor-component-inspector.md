# Component Inspector reference

When you select a component, the [Inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html) displays its information in two tabs:

* **Attributes:** Displays information about the componentâ€™s C# type, such as its namespace, member fields, and allocated chunk size.
* **Relationships**: Displays all Entities that have the selected component, and all systems that query the component, per world.

Click on the icon to the right of a system or entity name (![](images/editor-go-to.png)), to change the selection to that system or entity. Unity also opens the respective [System Inspector](editor-system-inspector.md) or [Entity Inspector](editor-entity-inspector.md) where possible.
