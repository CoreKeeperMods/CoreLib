# Entity Component System concepts
 
The Entities package uses the entity component system (ECS) architecture to organize code and data. An **entity** is a unique identifier, like a lightweight unmanaged alternative to a GameObject. An entity acts as an ID associated with individual **components** that contain data about the entity. Unlike GameObjects, entities contain no code: they're units of data that the systems you create process.
